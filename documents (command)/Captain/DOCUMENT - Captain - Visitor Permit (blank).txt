This document officially certifies that the designated individual is permitted by the stamping Captain to be a Visitor aboard their entrusted station. They are to be provided a Visitor ID card and passenger headset for the duration of their visit. As a Visitor, the designated individual is considered to be a member of the station's crew, and is therefore protected by (and subject to) Space Law.

[italic]The Captain (or other acting authority) reserves the right to revoke this permit at their discretion. Unauthorized redistribution or duplication of a station ID card or headset encryption key constitutes accessory to violation of Space Law codes 1-01 (Posession/Use of Minor Contraband) and/or 2-01 (Posession/Use of Major Contraband) and will result in immediate revocation of permit and possible disciplinary action.[/italic]
