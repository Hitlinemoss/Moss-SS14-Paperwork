[italic]Item Request Forms may include a "perpetual license", allowing for the named individual to request the same type of item again without requiring a new form. The Quartermaster may determine that stamped approval from one or more additional department heads is required depending on the nature of the request. Any department head that provides their stamp on an Item Request Form reserves the right to void that form at their discretion. The Captain, as the leading authority of the station, can provide their stamp on an Item Request Form or void an active Item Request Form in lieu of any department head, including the Quartermaster. In the event of an emergency, the Quartermaster, Captain, or other acting authority may elect to waive Item Request Form protocol.[/italic]
