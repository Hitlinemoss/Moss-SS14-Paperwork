The singularity used to power the station has breached containment and caused uncontrollable structural damage. The station is, for all practical purposes, uninhabitable. The station's surviving crew will be arriving at Central Command via the emergency evacuation shuttle shortly. Be advised that the singularity may still pose an active threat to Nanotrasen salvage teams attempting to appraise the station's remains in the future.
